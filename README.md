Study Buddies
======================
### About 
Study Buddies is dedicated to bettering the lives of CU Boulder CSCI students. Using this application, users can post the location they are at and what they are working on for a specific class. Then, they can email other people working on similar assignments to potentially meet up with them and study together. 
### Requirements 
You will need to do the following if you would like our application to work on your local machine: 
1) ```npm install``` in serverSide directory 
2) ```npm install``` in clientSide directory 
3) create an empty "studybuddies" database in PostgreSQL
3) ```knex migrate:latest``` in serverSide directory 
4) ```knex seed:run``` in serverSide directory 
**__A much quicker and easier alternative is to visit our Heroku deployment of our application__**
